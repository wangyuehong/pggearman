This package contains a set of Gearman functions for PostgreSQL. This
is a client interface which allows you to run submit Gearman jobs
from within PostgreSQL.

For more information about Gearman, see: http://gearman.org/

You will need PostgreSQL and the Gearman C server and Library package
which can be found at:

https://launchpad.net/gearmand

Once the Gearman package is installed, you can install the UDFs with:

make
make install

To load the UDFs for a database, run:

shell$ psql <database>
[database]=# \i /usr/local/postgresql/share/contrib/pggearman.sql

You should then have the following functions available:

gman_servers_set('localhost');

This function sets the Gearman job server to use. The
argument can be a list with optional port numbers, such as:
"192.168.1.3:4730,192.168.1.4:7003"


gman_do('reverse', 'Hello World!');
gman_do_high('reverse', 'Hello World!');
gman_do_low('reverse', 'Hello World!');

Each of these functions submit a foreground job to the job server
configured with gman_servers_set. These functions will block until the
job was run and the result is returned. The variants submit normal,
high, and low priority jobs.


gman_do_background('reverse', 'Hello World!');
gman_do_high_background('reverse', 'Hello World!');
gman_do_low_background('reverse', 'Hello World!');

Each of these functions submit a background job to the job server
configured with gman_servers_set. These functions will return as
soon as the job has been queued and return the job handle ID from
the job server.

POSTGRESQL CONFIGURATION

This module supports GUC (Grand Unified Configuration) variables.

Example of what we support in the Postgres configuration file: 
#custom_variable_classes = 'pggearman'  (9.2+)
pggearman.default_servers = 'localhost'
